Sample Steps:

The playbooks below are interactive and need to be run individually for every
k8s cluster to be migrated.

```
## Back up current etcd
$ ./deploy.sh -p etcd-migrate-00-backup.yml mexdemo platform

## Stop the controller and setup the new etcd persistent volumes
$ ./deploy.sh -p etcd-migrate-01.yml mexdemo platform

### Wait for all the `etcd-*-snapshot-setup-*` k8s batch jobs to complete

### Bring up the new statefulset etcd
$ ./deploy.sh -p etcd-migrate-02-bringup.yml mexdemo platform

### Bring up the controller with the new etcd
$ ./deploy.sh -p etcd-migrate-03-controller.yml mexdemo platform
```
