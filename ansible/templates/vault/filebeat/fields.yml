    description: 'The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if
      any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements
      on a host.

      Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields
      shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
      where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
    footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
      For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
      not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
      systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'

        This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.'

      description: 'Custom name of the agent.

        This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example
        two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation
        is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.

        If no name is given, the name is often left empty.'

      description: 'Type of the agent.

        The agent type stays always the same and should be given by the agent used.
        In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat
        instances are run on the same machine.'
