### Knife Exec Scripts

Reference : https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife_exec/

##### Supported scripts:
* `set_diagnostics.rb`
  * Used to set diagnostics on upcoming chef-client run of a node, will make chef-client collect logs and send it to artifactory. Hence, artifactory token is required to execute this script
  ```
  knife exec set_diagnostics.rb <node-name> <tar-file-name> <artifactory-token>
  ```
  * Artifactory admin can create access token by using the following command (Note: as per `expires_in` it is valid for 30mins):
  ```
  ‚ùØ curl -u "<username>":"<password>" -XPOST https://artifactory.mobiledgex.net/artifactory/api/security/token  -d "expires_in=1800" -d "username=diaguser" -d "scope=member-of-groups:diagnostics"

  ```
