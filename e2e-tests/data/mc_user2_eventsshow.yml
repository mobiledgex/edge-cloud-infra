# Please note that some of the autoprov events like creating two AppInsts
# for a new policy, or removing a cloudlet in a policy which results in
# an orphaned delete and create at the same time, result in non-deterministic
# orders of events. The filters below avoid queries that include both
# events from a set of non-deterministic order of events.
