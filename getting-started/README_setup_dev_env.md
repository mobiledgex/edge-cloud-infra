MobiledgeX Development Setup Procedure

setup_dev_env.sh sets up your environment on your macbook locally.
It essentially automates the steps on 'Getting Started' Confluence page (https://mobiledgex.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SWDEV/pages/22478869/Getting+Started)


Make sure your git setup is working.
   - you have a git account (aka GITHUB_ID) that is linked to mobilegex github account.
       * You have to provide your GITHUB_ID to Sunay to link it to MobiledgeX github account. 
   - you have git personal token setup. Getting Started page has instructions.


  

Get the setup_dev_env.sh script from github.com mobiledgex repo edge-cloud-infra under getting-started directory. Save it in /tmp directory on your macbook under your home directory and run it from there,

  ./setup_dev_env.sh
